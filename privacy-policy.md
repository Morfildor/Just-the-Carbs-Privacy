# Privacy policy — Just the Carbs

**Last updated:** 2026-09-30

This describes what the app actually does, verified against the source code (§48).

---

## In one paragraph

Just the Carbs has no account, no advertising, and no developer-configured analytics service. Your products, portions,
favourites and verified values stay on your device. **It is not true that no data leaves your
device:** when you scan a barcode the app has never seen, it sends that barcode to Open Food Facts
to look up the product, and — when that product has a photo — requests the photo too. If you use
**Search by name**, the words you type are also sent to Open Food Facts, because that is how the
search works, and the results' photos are requested too; some of those come from Open Food Facts'
image archive, which is hosted on Amazon Web Services (Amazon S3). Those three kinds of request are
the only ones Just the Carbs itself makes.

## What stays on your device

Stored locally in an app-private database, readable by no other app:

- Barcodes and product names you have scanned or entered
- Carbohydrate values and, for Open Food Facts products, protein values; measurement basis,
  package sizes
- Your verified values, and the online value they replaced
- Countable portion units (e.g. "1 slice = 36 g"), whether suggested by Open Food Facts or
  entered by you, and whether you have checked them against the package
- The last portion or countable-unit count you used per product, and when you last used it
- Portions you have used more than once for a product, so they can be offered as shortcuts. These
  are kept per product; the app has no way to assemble them into a picture of what you eat overall
- The items in your **current meal**, if you are using that feature. There is only ever one meal
  and it has no name and no date. It stays until you clear it — including across a restart, so you
  do not lose a half-built plate by switching apps — but the app has no way to store a *past* meal,
  so it holds no record of meals you have eaten
- The **dish** you are building, if you are using that feature: the ingredients you added, how
  much of each, the value each was calculated with, and how many portions the dish makes or what
  it weighed (as a whole, or plate by plate as you served it, with the empty container you took
  off). There is only ever one and it has no name; when you are editing a saved dish, it also
  notes which one. The time each ingredient was added and the time the dish last changed are
  kept, to keep the ingredients in order and to tell a dish left since yesterday from one being
  made now; they are never shown. The dish stays until you save it, clear it, start another or
  remove its last ingredient, including across a restart
- Dishes you chose to save: the name you gave each, what went into it, how many portions it makes
  or what it weighed, when it was saved and when you last opened it (to put the dishes you open
  most recently first). Nothing about a serving is kept: not how many portions you had, when, or
  what is left
- The weights of the last three pans or bowls you subtracted from a scale reading, so they can
  be offered again. They are weights only and have no names
- Favourites, and your settings (theme, result style, haptics, the protein reading, and whether
  Home shows your favourites or your dishes)

There is no login, no cloud profile, and no synchronisation. Deleting the app deletes all of it.

## What leaves your device

**Three things: a barcode lookup, a product photo, and — only if you use it — a search you typed.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Recipient | Open Food Facts, for product data (`world.openfoodfacts.org`), search (`search.openfoodfacts.org`, or `world.openfoodfacts.org` if that service does not answer) and product photos (`images.openfoodfacts.org` or `static.openfoodfacts.org`; for search results, also Open Food Facts' image archive at `openfoodfacts-images.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com`, which runs on Amazon Web Services infrastructure, Amazon S3) |
| When | Product data: only when you scan or enter a barcode not already saved on your device. Photos: when that lookup returns a product that has a photo, and for each result shown while you search by name. Some search-result photos are served from Open Food Facts' Amazon S3-hosted image archive: the app uses the archive only when it can tell the archived photo is the same, unedited picture, and otherwise — or when the archive does not have it — uses Open Food Facts' own image host. The app checks every photo address and will not load an image from any other host. Search text: while you search by name — once you have typed at least three characters and paused for about a third of a second, or when you press the search action. Fewer than three characters are never sent |
| What is sent | The barcode number and a User-Agent identifying the app and version (product lookup); a standard image request with no additional data attached (photo); the search words, plus the list of languages whose product names should be searched (search). That list starts with Turkish when your phone's language is Turkish, so it can reveal that setting. Your phone's region is used only on the device, to order the results, and is not sent |
| What Just the Carbs does not attach to these requests | An account/user ID, advertising ID, your portions, results, history, or verified values. The recipient still receives normal network metadata such as IP address |
| Transport | HTTPS only. Cleartext traffic is disabled at the platform level |

**About the search text specifically.** Unlike a barcode, this is text you typed, so it deserves
naming rather than folding into "product lookups". It is sent while you search —
after you pause typing, not on every keystroke — with no app-supplied user identifier, and Just the Carbs does
not store it on your device or on a Just the Carbs server — the app keeps no search history and has
no server. Open Food Facts' own retention of search requests was not established by a primary
source in the 2026-08-14 review. If you do not use Search by name, nothing of this kind is sent by
Just the Carbs.

Open Food Facts is an independent organisation and will receive your IP address as an unavoidable
part of any internet request. Their handling of that is governed by their own privacy policy. A
search-result photo served from Open Food Facts' image archive travels over Amazon Web Services
infrastructure, so Amazon Web Services, which operates that storage for Open Food Facts, also
receives that request's network metadata, such as your IP address.

A cached product — and an already-loaded photo — is served without a new network request, so
re-using a product typically sends nothing.

## Camera

The camera is used for two things: reading barcodes, and reading nutrition labels.

- Processing is **on-device**. Live camera frames are processed in memory and discarded
  immediately.
- When you explicitly capture a nutrition label, a temporary image is stored in the app's private
  cache solely for on-device OCR and deleted immediately after processing. Images are not uploaded
  or retained.
- The app requests no storage or photo-library permission, so it cannot see your gallery, and the
  temporary capture above is never written anywhere a gallery or another app could see it.
- Camera access is asked for when you first open the scanner, not at launch, and you can decline —
  manual entry always remains available.

## What Just the Carbs does not contain

No advertising SDK. No advertising ID. No developer-configured analytics or crash-reporting
service. No social login. No Health Connect. No Bluetooth. No location permission or location
feature. Just the Carbs does not sell data or share it for advertising. ML Kit's SDK metrics are described
separately below.

## One thing we want to be precise about

Just the Carbs uses **Google ML Kit** for barcode and label recognition. Google states that camera input
and recognition results are processed on-device and are not sent to Google. Google also states that
the SDK collects device and app information, per-installation identifiers, performance metrics,
API configuration, feature events and errors for diagnostics and usage analytics. Google says this
data is encrypted in transit and not transferred to third parties. See Google's
[ML Kit disclosure](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/android-data-disclosure) and
[Terms & Privacy](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms), checked 2026-08-14.

The SDK's `com.google.android.datatransport` component cannot be removed without breaking barcode
scanning (verified in an emulator experiment) and adds `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`. Just the Carbs does not
control Google's retention of those metrics. The proposed Play declarations are in
[google-play-data-safety.md](google-play-data-safety.md).

## Backup

Android backup is **disabled** (`allowBackup="false"`). Your food history is never copied to your
Google account. The trade-off: your saved products do not transfer to a new phone.

## Your control

| You want to | Do this |
|---|---|
| Remove usage history, keep verified products and saved dishes | Settings → Clear recent history |
| Delete every saved product and dish and everything derived from them | Settings → Clear saved products |
| Discard the dish you are building | Open it from Home, then its menu → Clear dish (while editing a saved dish, Discard changes) |
| Delete one saved dish | Open it, then its menu → Delete dish (or press and hold its card on Home) |
| Remove all data permanently | Uninstall the app |
| Stop all network requests | Use the app offline; saved products keep working |

Precisely what the two Settings actions do:

- **Clear recent history** forgets *that you used* anything. For every product — favourites
  included — it clears the last-used time, the last portion, the remembered portion mode, the
  remembered countable unit and the remembered count, and it deletes every usual-portion record
  and the pan weights remembered for dishes. Your products, your saved dishes, their
  carbohydrate values, your verifications and your favourites all stay, and so does a dish you
  are still building.
- **Clear saved products** deletes every saved product, every countable portion unit and every
  usual-portion record. It also deletes every dish you saved, with its list of ingredients, and
  the pan weights remembered for dishes. It does **not** change your app preferences (theme,
  result style, haptics) or discard the meal you are currently assembling or the dish you are
  still building — none of those is saved product data, and this row previously said "delete
  everything the app has stored", which overstated it.

There is no account to delete, because there is no account.

## Children

Just the Carbs is not directed at children. It has no child-oriented design, account, advertising, or
public user content. The same Open Food Facts requests and ML Kit collection described above apply
regardless of a user's age; no separate claim of zero collection is made for children.

## Changes

Material changes to this policy will be reflected here with an updated date, published alongside the
app release that introduces them.
